# Analysis Roadmap

1. Lineage and Workflow Quality Checklist
  a. Remove Workflows that are instructive/examples with unrelated cells
  b. Verify Lineage - Edges by visual analysis
  c. Manually Annotate Schema and PK columns

2. Point Preserving Checklist
  a. Schema matching and row alignment verification
  b. Clustering workflows by schema/PK
  c. Edge similarity threshold sensitivity study

3. Non-Point preserving Checklist
  a. Merge / Join detector design
  b. Grouping/Aggregation detector design
  c. Pivot Detector Design


Goal: 10ish hand-annotated workflows that are challenging.
